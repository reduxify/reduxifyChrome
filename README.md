# Seedux
A Chrome developer tool that provides a new tab that actively logs and visualizes the Redux data flow, enabling easier, faster debugging of any React-Redux implementation.

# Features
- Time travel functionality for your Redux store.
- Persistent log of every action dispatched, resulting store diffs, and complete new store.
- Configurable visualization of actionCreators, reducers, and ui props if using react-redux.
- Illumination of relevant actionsCreators and reducers upon action dispatch.
- Settings menu to customize view.
- Ability to dispatch actions with custom payloads
- Import/Export and Stash/Unstash complete store logs from disk or localStorage, respectively.

# How to Install

### NPM Module (recommended)

Seedux can be easily installed as a developer dependency with npm using your favorite terminal.

```javascript
npm install seedux --save-dev
```

### Development Version

For a codebase suitable for modification, clone our git repository to an easily accessible file path on your computer and run the build:

```bash
cd seedux_repo_path
npm install
npm run build:both
```

## Getting Started:

Import `combineReducers`, `connect`, and `bindActionCreators` from Seedux, rather than Redux/React-Redux. The examples below assume you are working with the npm module. If you are working from the git repo, replace 'seedux' with your repo path!

```javascript
// import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { combineReducers } from 'seedux';
```

```javascript
// import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { connect } from 'seedux';
```

__Note__: Seedux relies on bindActionCreators to parse your action types at runtime and provide visual feedback on dispatched actions.  If you are not using bindActionCreators, you can pass your actions directly to seeduxInit instead.

```javascript
// import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';
import { bindActionCreators } from 'seedux';
```

Import `dispatchLogger` from Seedux and apply it as middleware when invoking createStore.

Import and call `seeduxInit`. Pass `seeduxInit` your newly created store (and actionCreators if not using bindActionCreators).

```javascript
import { dispatchLogger, seeduxInit } from 'seedux';
import * as actionCreators from './actions';

const store = createStore(combinedReducers, preloadedState, applyMiddleware(dispatchLogger));
seeduxInit(store, actionCreators);
```

Navigate to chrome://extensions

Click 'load as an unpacked extension' and select ```seedux_repo_path + 'seedux/seeduxChrome'```

Open your redux app in the browser.

Click on the seeduxChrome extension icon to launch the dev tool!

## Complete Example Integration

The following import examples are for the npm package. Replace <'seedux'> with your Seedux repo filepath to use the development version.

### Import dispatchLogger from Seedux and replace Redux's <a href='http://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html'>createStore</a> function with Seedux's version. Invoke createStore as normal with applyMiddleware(dispatchLogger) as the third argument. Invoke seeduxInit with your store (and actionCreators, if not using bindActionCreators).

```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { render } from 'react-dom';
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import { applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
    import { createStore, dispatchLogger } from 'seedux';
    import { combinedReducer } from './reducers';
    import App from './components/App';
    import * as actionCreators from './actions';
    const preloadedState = {};

    const store = createStore(combinedReducer, preloadedState, applyMiddleware(dispatchLogger));
    seeduxInit(store, actionCreators);

    render(
      <Provider store = { store }>
        <App />
      </Provider>,
      document.getElementById('app')
    );
```
### Replace Redux's <a href='http://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html'>combineReducers</a> function with Seedux's version and invoke it with arguments as normal:

```javascript
    // import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
    import { combineReducers } from 'seedux';
    import reducer1 from './reducer1';
    import reducer2 from './reducer2';

    const combinedReducer = combineReducers({
      reducer1: reducer1,
      reducer2: reducer2
    });

    export default combinedReducer;
```

### Replace Redux's <a href='http://redux.js.org/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html'>bindActionCreators</a> function with Seedux's version and invoke it with arguments as normal:

```javascript
    // import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';
    import { bindActionCreators } from 'seedux';
    import * as allActionCreators from './actions';

    const boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators(allActionCreators, dispatch);
```

### Replace React-Redux's <a href='https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options'>connect</a> function with Seedux's version and invoke it with arguments as normal:

```javascript
    // import { connect } from 'react-redux';
    import { connect } from 'seedux';
    import { myComponent } from './components/myComponent';

    const container = connect()(myComponent);
```
